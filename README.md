# Self Balance Robot

This repo serves as a record of my attempt to build a self balance robot.

Future Improvements:
- Through holes in PCB board is too small for mounting with M3 threads, requires some filing
- Need to place wheel motor mounting points closer to the edge
- Wheel does not turn at magnitudes lower than 0.5 (Due to friction within the motor?)
- Integrate W
