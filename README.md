# Self Balance Robot

This serves as a record of my attempt to build a self balance robot.

Current Issues:
- Through holes in PCB board is too small for mounting with M3 threads
- Need to place wheel motor mounting points closer to the edge
- Wheel does not turn at magnitudes lower than 0.5 (Due to friction within the motor?)
